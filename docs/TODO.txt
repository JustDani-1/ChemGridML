13.08.:
-------
- prepare for meeting with Mark, to determine the direction of the project
- discuss, whether it makes sense to just consider the molecular descriptors
- what to predict?: just chemical properties or targets?
- TDC or ChEMBL
- show him the paper, prepare to present it to Mark
- search for other papers about my project


Presentation for Mark:
- present the papers
- quickly show MoleculeNet
- ask him in which direction the project should go? 
- molecular target or property prediction?
- go nuts with the featurizations or with the model types?
- WHAT IS THE DIRECTION OR QUESTION I AM TRYING TO ANSWER?
- use data and models like in Mayr but with the diversity of descriptors from the others?
- More diverse architectures: FNN, RNN, KNN, NB, SVM, RF, ...
-> would result in A LOT of models/computation


Follow-up:
- focus on combination of representation x model x dataset
- property prediction, not target prediction
- try to use curated datasets at first and then maybe try to use ChEMBL-extracted datasets, compare performance
- features -> models -> datasets
