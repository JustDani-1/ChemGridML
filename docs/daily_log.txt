SHORT DAILY LOG OF WORK:

11.08.:
-------
- SoP tour with Mark
- Meeting with Mark & David, outline of what the project is about
- skimmed the computational_pharmaceutics git course
- started reading about Morgan Fingerprints, Molecular Grammars

Papers:
- Hierarchical Grammar-Induced Geometry for Data-Efficient Molecular Property Prediction
- DATA-EFFICIENT GRAPH GRAMMAR LEARNING FOR MOLECULAR GENERATION

12.08.:
-------
- first look at TDC
- first FNN with Morgan Fingerprint Features for Caco2 dataset
- implemented kFold CrossValidation to avoid overfitting
- hyperparameter optimization with optuna

13.08.:
-------
- altered training for model to return best validation score model -> better scores and hyperparameter selection stability
- took notes about the papers, researched their techniques
- prepared to present to Mark tomorrow

Papers:
- Baptista et al, Stepisnik et al, Mayr et al

14.08.:
-------
- meeting with Mark, determined outline/goal of the project
- focus on molecule property prediction
- test diversity of features, models and datasets

15.08.:
-------
- fingerprints implementations
- research on graphical featurization techniques


18.08.:
-------
- wrote a bunch of python code
- implemented fingerprint x model x dataset loop and trying to get it working

19.08.:
-------
- improved the training loop
- wrote a bunch of emails regarding the UCL mail
- setup latex and zotero for project documentation

20.08.:
-------
- group meeting
- got UCL mail and access to Myriad
- setup sklearn models 
- improved visulization

21.08.:
-------
- meeting with David
- trying to get fp x model x dataset (small params) to run through on Myriad
- got a couple of relevant papers from David
- reading papers, thinking about how to replicate/improve their techniques

22.08.:
-------
- mostly reading Deng et al.
- trying to develop own ideas from the paper to fit in

25.08.:
-------
- rethought the model training process to ensure both hyperparam optim and multiple final performances
- started on implementing multithreaded version

26.08.:
-------
- completed multithreaded version, one single predictions.db and studies.db
- analysis and visulization for predictions.db
- queued large job with all combinations on myriad

01.09.:
-------
- rewrote the job to use array job on myriad
- talked with Mark about MD Benchmark
- fixed and reran array jobs
