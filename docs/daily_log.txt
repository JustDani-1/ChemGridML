SHORT DAILY LOG OF WORK:

11.08.:
-------
- SoP tour with Mark
- Meeting with Mark & David, outline of what the project is about
- skimmed the computational_pharmaceutics git course
- started reading about Morgan Fingerprints, Molecular Grammars

12.08.:
-------
- first look at TDC
- first FNN with Morgan Fingerprint Features for Caco2 dataset
- implemented kFold CrossValidation to avoid overfitting
- hyperparameter optimization with optuna

13.08.:
-------
- altered training for model to return best validation score model -> better scores and hyperparameter selection stability
- took notes about the papers, researched their techniques
- prepared to present to Mark tomorrow

Papers:
- Baptista et al, Stepisnik et al, Mayr et al

14.08.:
-------
- meeting with Mark, determined outline/goal of the project
- focus on molecule property prediction
- test diversity of features, models and datasets

15.08.:
-------
- fingerprints implementations
- research on graphical featurization techniques


18.08.:
-------
- wrote a bunch of python code
- implemented fingerprint x model x dataset loop and trying to get it working

19.08.:
-------
- improved the training loop
- wrote a bunch of emails regarding the UCL mail
- setup latex and zotero for project documentation

20.08.:
-------
- group meeting
- got UCL mail and access to Myriad
- setup sklearn models 
- improved visulization

21.08.:
-------
- meeting with David
- trying to get fp x model x dataset (small params) to run through on Myriad
- got a couple of relevant papers from David
- reading papers, thinking about how to replicate/improve their techniques

22.08.:
-------
- mostly reading Deng et al.
- trying to develop own ideas from the paper to fit in

25.08.:
-------
- rethought the model training process to ensure both hyperparam optim and multiple final performances
- started on implementing multithreaded version

26.08.:
-------
- completed multithreaded version, one single predictions.db and studies.db
- analysis and visulization for predictions.db
- queued large job with all combinations on myriad

01.09.:
-------
- rewrote the job to use array job on myriad
- talked with Mark about MD Benchmark
- fixed and reran array jobs

02.09.:
-------
- nested cross-validation
- multithreading for train-test splits
- method to get the 10 longest running jobs
- investigation on some jobs freezing
- finally able to replicate the problem, wondering what causes it


03.09.:
-------
- finalized the finerprint x model x dataset pipeline
- ran final job with default fingerprint size 1024
- worked with Mark on MD Myriad optimization

04.09.:
-------
- complete pesky UCL courses about safety, diversity, ...
- meeting with Mark & David
=> new direction: new experiment with deepchem framework for learnable models
=> after that: pre-trained models (GROVER, MOLBERT, maybe even remove MOL2VEC from fingerprints)
=> after that: dataset size aspect, benchmark how the performance of the model changes for different dataset sizes

05.09.:
-------
- helping Sara with python
- re-abstracted the models so that uniform interface for pytorch, sklearn, deepchem

08.09.:
-------
- helped Mark with running array job 
- implemented GAT and GCN
