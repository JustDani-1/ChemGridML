  abstract = {Machine learning (ML) is increasingly being used to guide drug discovery processes. When applying ML approaches to chemical datasets, molecular descriptors and fingerprints are typically used to represent compounds as numerical vectors. However, in recent years, end-to-end deep learning (DL) methods that can learn feature representations directly from line notations or molecular graphs have been proposed as alternatives to using precomputed features. This study set out to investigate which compound representation methods are the most suitable for drug sensitivity prediction in cancer cell lines. Twelve different representations were benchmarked on 5 compound screening datasets, using DeepMol, a new chemoinformatics package developed by our research group, to perform these analyses. The results of this study show that the predictive performance of end-to-end DL models is comparable to, and at times surpasses, that of models trained on molecular fingerprints, even when less training data is available. This study also found that combining several compound representation methods into an ensemble can improve performance. Finally, we show that a post hoc feature attribution method can boost the explainability of the DL models.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has been widely applied in drug discovery with a major task as molecular property prediction. Despite booming techniques in molecular representation learning, key elements underlying molecular property prediction remain largely unexplored, which impedes further advancements in this field. Herein, we conduct an extensive evaluation of representative models using various representations on the MoleculeNet datasets, a suite of opioids-related datasets and two additional activity datasets from the literature. To investigate the predictive power in low-data and high-data space, a series of descriptors datasets of varying sizes are also assembled to evaluate the models. In total, we have trained 62,820 models, including 50,220 models on fixed representations, 4200 models on SMILES sequences and 8400 models on molecular graphs. Based on extensive experimentation and rigorous comparison, we show that representation learning models exhibit limited performance in molecular property prediction in most datasets. Besides, multiple key elements underlying molecular property prediction can affect the evaluation results. Furthermore, we show that activity cliffs can significantly impact model prediction. Finally, we explore into potential causes why representation learning models can fail and show that dataset size is essential for representation learning models to excel.},

  abstract = {This study, focusing on predicting Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicology (ADMET) properties, addresses the key challenges of ML models trained using ligand-based representations. We propose a structured approach to data feature selection, taking a step beyond the conventional practice of combining different representations without systematic reasoning. Additionally, we enhance model evaluation methods by integrating cross-validation with statistical hypothesis testing, adding a layer of reliability to the model assessments. Our final evaluations include a practical scenario, where models trained on one source of data are evaluated on a different one. This approach aims to bolster the reliability of ADMET predictions, providing more dependable and informative model evaluations.},

  abstract = {Deep learning is currently the most successful machine learning technique in a wide range of application areas and has recently been applied successfully in drug discovery research to predict potential drug targets and to screen for active molecules. However, due to (1) the lack of large-scale studies, (2) the compound series bias that is characteristic of drug discovery datasets and (3) the hyperparameter selection bias that comes with the high number of potential deep learning architectures, it remains unclear whether deep learning can indeed outperform existing computational methods in drug discovery tasks. We therefore assessed the performance of several deep learning methods on a large-scale drug discovery dataset and compared the results with those of other machine learning and target prediction methods. To avoid potential biases from hyperparameter selection or compound series, we used a nested cluster-cross-validation strategy. We found (1) that deep learning methods significantly outperform all competing methods and (2) that the predictive performance of deep learning is in many cases comparable to that of tests performed in wet labs (i.e., in vitro assays).},

  abstract = {Machine learning methods are commonly used for predicting molecular properties to accelerate material and drug design. An important part of this process is deciding how to represent the molecules. Typically, machine learning methods expect examples represented by vectors of values, and many methods for calculating molecular feature representations have been proposed. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive comparison of different molecular features, including traditional methods such as fingerprints and molecular descriptors, and recently proposed learnable representations based on neural networks. Feature representations are evaluated on 11 benchmark datasets, used for predicting properties and measures such as mutagenicity, melting points, activity, solubility, and IC50. Our experiments show that several molecular features work similarly well over all benchmark datasets. The ones that stand out most are Spectrophores, which give significantly worse performance than other features on most datasets. Molecular descriptors from the PaDEL library seem very well suited for predicting physical properties of molecules. Despite their simplicity, MACCS fingerprints performed very well overall. The results show that learnable representations achieve competitive performance compared to expert based representations. However, task-specific representations (graph convolutions and Weave methods) rarely offer any benefits, even though they are computationally more demanding. Lastly, combining different molecular feature representations typically does not give a noticeable improvement in performance compared to individual feature representations.},
