  abstract = {Machine learning (ML) is increasingly being used to guide drug discovery processes. When applying ML approaches to chemical datasets, molecular descriptors and fingerprints are typically used to represent compounds as numerical vectors. However, in recent years, end-to-end deep learning (DL) methods that can learn feature representations directly from line notations or molecular graphs have been proposed as alternatives to using precomputed features. This study set out to investigate which compound representation methods are the most suitable for drug sensitivity prediction in cancer cell lines. Twelve different representations were benchmarked on 5 compound screening datasets, using DeepMol, a new chemoinformatics package developed by our research group, to perform these analyses. The results of this study show that the predictive performance of end-to-end DL models is comparable to, and at times surpasses, that of models trained on molecular fingerprints, even when less training data is available. This study also found that combining several compound representation methods into an ensemble can improve performance. Finally, we show that a post hoc feature attribution method can boost the explainability of the DL models.},

  abstract = {Deep learning is currently the most successful machine learning technique in a wide range of application areas and has recently been applied successfully in drug discovery research to predict potential drug targets and to screen for active molecules. However, due to (1) the lack of large-scale studies, (2) the compound series bias that is characteristic of drug discovery datasets and (3) the hyperparameter selection bias that comes with the high number of potential deep learning architectures, it remains unclear whether deep learning can indeed outperform existing computational methods in drug discovery tasks. We therefore assessed the performance of several deep learning methods on a large-scale drug discovery dataset and compared the results with those of other machine learning and target prediction methods. To avoid potential biases from hyperparameter selection or compound series, we used a nested cluster-cross-validation strategy. We found (1) that deep learning methods significantly outperform all competing methods and (2) that the predictive performance of deep learning is in many cases comparable to that of tests performed in wet labs (i.e., in vitro assays).},

  abstract = {Machine learning methods are commonly used for predicting molecular properties to accelerate material and drug design. An important part of this process is deciding how to represent the molecules. Typically, machine learning methods expect examples represented by vectors of values, and many methods for calculating molecular feature representations have been proposed. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive comparison of different molecular features, including traditional methods such as fingerprints and molecular descriptors, and recently proposed learnable representations based on neural networks. Feature representations are evaluated on 11 benchmark datasets, used for predicting properties and measures such as mutagenicity, melting points, activity, solubility, and IC50. Our experiments show that several molecular features work similarly well over all benchmark datasets. The ones that stand out most are Spectrophores, which give significantly worse performance than other features on most datasets. Molecular descriptors from the PaDEL library seem very well suited for predicting physical properties of molecules. Despite their simplicity, MACCS fingerprints performed very well overall. The results show that learnable representations achieve competitive performance compared to expert based representations. However, task-specific representations (graph convolutions and Weave methods) rarely offer any benefits, even though they are computationally more demanding. Lastly, combining different molecular feature representations typically does not give a noticeable improvement in performance compared to individual feature representations.},
